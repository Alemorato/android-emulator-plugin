<b>Emulator Engine 2.0 only</b><br/>
Defines the device definition to use for the <b>A</b>ndroid <b>V</b>irtual <b>D</b>evice. The available list can be retrieved via '<code>avdmanager list device</code>'.<br/>
For the android tools itself, this value is optional, but the plugin requires it to be set, as otherwise the command will prompt for an user input on the command line.<br/>
If you still use the legacy Emulator Engine, the value is ignored.
